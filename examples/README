Examples for Config::Merge
===========================

There are four examples of the usage of Config::Merge:

1) 'oo.pl' and 'func.pl' illustrate the two ways of using Config::Merge
   They dump the config data corresponding to the path you type in.

   To run them, try this:

      perl oo.pl
      perl oo.pl app.images
      perl oo.pl app.html_filter.BanAllBut
      perl oo.pl app.html_filter.BanAllBut.2

      OR

      perl func.pl
      perl func.pl app.images
      perl func.pl app.html_filter.BanAllBut
      perl func.pl app.html_filter.BanAllBut.2

   You need to have YAML::Syck or YAML installed to use these examples

2) 'browser.pl' allows you to compare the data between a production environment
   and a development environment.  The only difference between the data is
   the 'local.yaml' file in 'config_dev/local.yaml'

   To try it, type:
       perl browser.pl
    OR perl browser.pl debug

   Then enter the path to the data you want (eg 'app.images.path')
   or you can just press Enter to start.

   You need to have Term::ReadLine and YAML::Syck or YAML installed to use
   this example


3) 'advanced.pl' illustrates how to define your own methods for is_local()
   and load_as(). It shows the same config data for the production server
   and for the machines 'dev1' and 'dev2'

       perl advanced.pl
    OR perl advanced.pl debug
